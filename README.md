# Home-Forum-System
Using limited knowledge of Node.js and Express, this is my attempt at creating a sort of "online forum" for a LAN. There may be bad practice, as this is my first attempt at a proper project using these tools.

the IPv4 address found in the source code is the address of my current machine running the server, and should be changed to match that of your machine.

This can be done on windows by typing in command prompt:
  ipconfig
or on linux/Mac with their shell using:
  ipconfig -a

log files were removed to ensure any local changes done on my own home system isn't added to the github repository.

The filenames can be changed in the src, and is left to users choice.
